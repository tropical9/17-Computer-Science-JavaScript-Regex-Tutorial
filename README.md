## [Matching an Email Gist](https://gist.github.com/tropical9/4fe358ec56d7ab969f7dda02c82af052.js)


## Description
This gist project was created for my coding bootdcamp. The goal of this challenge is to create a tutorial that explains how a specific regular expression, or regex, functions by breaking dow each part of the expression and describing what it does. 

```
User Story
AS A web development student
I WANT a tutorial explaining a specific regex
SO THAT I can understand the search pattern the regex defines
Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a regex tutorial
WHEN I open the tutorial
THEN I see a descriptive title and introductory paragraph explaining the purpose of the tutorial, a summary describing the regex featured in the tutorial, a table of contents linking to different sections that break down each component of the regex and explain what it does, and a section about the author with a link to the author’s GitHub profile
WHEN I click on the links in the table of contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding sections of the tutorial
WHEN I read through each section of the tutorial
THEN I find a detailed explanation of what a specific component of the regex does
WHEN I reach the end of the tutorial
THEN I find a section about the author and a link to the author’s GitHub profile

```
